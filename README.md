# IPv4SubnetGenerator
This simple tools allows you using the last two octets to generate a list of subnets by specificying the size in hosts, for example 256, 128, 64, 32 or 2 From here 
the tool will generate you a table containing the network address, first host address, last host address and broadcast address for each of the subnets you have created.

Lastly we can specify the amount of subnets we want to look at or need, this will generate upto that amount then stop. If we leave this blank the script will run upto 2000 subnets.
